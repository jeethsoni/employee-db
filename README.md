### **Description**
Man, what can I say, I am really enjoying normalizing the tables and as it comes naturally to mind what to do next and how to break it down, it becomes more fun because I know what I am doing. This time it's a employee database. I broke it down from a excel file, normalized and built the tables to keep records of employees.
